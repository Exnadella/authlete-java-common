DE01 = A transformed claim was found.
DE02 = The property is unavailable, and therefore omitted.
DE03 = The property is available as array or object, but omitted for the data minimization policy.
DE04 = The request does not have constraints for the property, and therefore the property is put in the copy unconditionally.
DE05 = The request format is invalid, so matching fails.
DE06 = The property does not satisfy the constraint, so matching fails.
DE07 = The property does not satisfy the constraint, and therefore the property is omitted.
DE08 = The property satisfies the constraint, and therefore the property is put in the copy.
DE09 = The request has no constraint for the property, and therefore the property is put in the copy unconditionally.
DE10 = The request has no constraint for the property, but the property is omitted because its value is unavailable.
DE11 = The request has sub properties but the actual data in the original dataset is a single value, so matching fails.
DE12 = The element in the array in the original dataset is not an object. The element is ignored.
DE13 = The element in the array in the original dataset meets conditions of the request, so the element is put in the copy.
DE14 = None of the elements in the array in the original dataset meet conditions of the request, so matching fails.
DE15 = The request is an array, but the property in the original dataset is neither an object nor an array. Therefore, matching fails.
DE16 = The element in the array in the request is not an object. It is a specification violation. The element is ignored.
DE17 = The property in the original dataset satisfies conditions of the element in the array in the request.
DE18 = The element in the array in the original dataset is not an object. The element is ignored.
DE19 = The element in the array in the request is not an object. It is a specification violation. The element is ignored.
DE20 = The element in the array in the original dataset satisfies conditions of the element in the array in the request.
DE21 = None of the elements in the array in the original dataset satisfy any of the elements in the array in the request. Therefore, matching fails.
DE22 = Some elements in the array in the original dataset satisfy any of the elements in the array in the request.
DE23 = All available sub-elements under 'assurance_details' are unconditionally returned based on the special rule for the property.
